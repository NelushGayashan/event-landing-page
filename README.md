# 🎉 Event Landing Page

This is a modern, responsive **event landing page** built with **React, Vite, and Tailwind CSS**. It features a detailed event overview, speaker profiles with interactive pop-ups, a dynamic agenda, and a robust registration form. The form is powered by **Formik** and **Yup** for state management and validation, and uses **react-hot-toast** for user feedback. The project includes a simple **Node.js server** to handle form submissions.
